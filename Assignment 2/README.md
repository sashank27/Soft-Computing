# Assignment 2

* Use housing price dataset. Using various parameters in the datasets we need to predict the housing price.
    * Predict housing price using normal equations with regularizer.
    * Predict housing price using gradient descent with regulariser.
    * Compare the results for both approaches
    * Design alpha and lambda parameters so that hypothesis will perform better.
        - Case 1 : Use all dataset for training.
        - Case 2 : 70% to design hypothesis and 30% to test hypothesis
    Find the differences and conclude analysis

* Use HP data to implement LWR .You may take neighbouring batch size of data.Discuss
what will happen when tau is very small.
