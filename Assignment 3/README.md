# Assignment 3

* Using the data set of two examination results design a predictor using logistic
regression for predicting whether a student can get an admission in the institution. Use
regularizer to further tune the parameters. Use 70 % data for training and rest 30% data
for testing your predictor and calculate the efficiency of the predictor/hypothesis.
* Using the data set of two quality test results of a microchip product, design a predictor
using logistic regression which will predict the acceptance or rejection of the microchip
given the two test results. Use regularizer to further tune the parameters. Use 70 %
data for training and rest 30% data for testing your predictor and calculate the
efficiency of the predictor/hypothesis.

For both the questions, you can pre process the data for convenience.
You must use Python program for evaluating parameters using batch gradient
descent algorithm (GDA). No function should be used for GDA.
